<h1>Hello there!</h1>
<img src="../assets/images/Me.JPG" height="400" alt="Picture of myself" />
<p>
  My name is Agnetha and i'm a dedicated IT student studying IT Product
  development in Denmark. I am a motivated individual seeking to improve and
  acquire new skills that challenge and develop my professional and personal
  competencies.
</p>

<p>
  When I'm not immersed in the digital world, you'll find me with my running
  shoes tightly laced, ready to tackle the next kilometer on my journey towards
  a half marathon, or deeply buried in the pages of a fantasy book, where I
  immerse myself in the world of adventure. I'm always on the lookout for new
  skills to master – from languages to software – and I try to take more risks
  and step out of my comfort zone.

  Growing up I always had him by my side. His name is Anton, and I looove him
  sooo much!
